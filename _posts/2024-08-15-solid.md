Your'e walking at the street, look around and then just realize you still don't know SOLID, that's why I'm here.

# What in a hell is S.O.L.I.D.?

The year is 2000, the renowned developer Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob," was facing a common challenge in the world of software development: the difficulty of maintaining and evolving complex systems. As the complexity of software projects grew, many developers struggled to create systems that were easy to understand, modify, and expand.

In response to this scenario, Uncle Bob began working on a set of principles that could help developers address these issues. He introduced the concept of SOLID, an acronym for five fundamental principles designed to improve code structure and flexibility. These principles were intended to solve problems such as high coupling between components, difficulty in adding new features, and the complexity of legacy code.

In this article we gonna go through the following principles:

- **S - Single Responsibility Principle**
- **O - Open/Closed Principle**
- **L - Liskov Substitution Principle**
- **I - Interface Segregation Principle**
- **D - Dependency Inversion Principle**

# SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle states that we, as developers, should always strive to assign only **ONE responsibility** to each class individually. In other words, no class should take on multiple, unrelated duties. By adhering to this principle, we can ensure that our classes are easier to maintain, understand, and modify, as each class will have a clear, well-defined purpose.

For instance, imagine you’re building a simple online store. You might be tempted to create a class called `OrderManager` that handles everything related to an order: processing payments, sending confirmation emails, updating inventory, and more, as following example:

```typescript
class OrderManager {
  // Process payment, update inventory, and send email all in one class
  placeOrder(productId: string, quantity: number, amount: number): void {
    this.processPayment(amount);
    this.updateInventory(productId, quantity);

    const orderId = this.generateOrderId();
    this.sendConfirmationEmail(orderId);

    console.log('Order placed successfully!');
  }

  private processPayment(amount: number): void {
    console.log(`Processing payment of $${amount}`);
  }

  private updateInventory(productId: string, quantity: number): void {
    console.log(`Updating inventory for product ${productId}, reducing by ${quantity}`);
  }

  private sendConfirmationEmail(orderId: string): void {
    console.log(`Sending confirmation email for order ${orderId}`);
  }

  private generateOrderId(): string {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substring(7); // Generate a simple order ID
  }
}
```

However, this violates SRP, as this class has multiple responsibilities. Instead, you could break it down into:

- A `PaymentProcessor` class responsible solely for handling payments.
- An `EmailService` class dedicated to sending confirmation emails.
- An `InventoryManager` class that manages the stock.

```typescript
// Class responsible for processing payments
class PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount: number): void {
    console.log(`Processing payment of $${amount}`);
  }
}

// Class responsible for sending emails
class EmailService {
  sendConfirmationEmail(orderId: string): void {
    console.log(`Sending confirmation email for order ${orderId}`);
  }
}

// Class responsible for managing inventory
class InventoryManager {
  updateInventory(productId: string, quantity: number): void {
    console.log(`Updating inventory for product ${productId}, reducing by ${quantity}`);
  }
}

// High-level OrderManager class that coordinates actions but does not perform them
class OrderManager {
  private paymentProcessor: PaymentProcessor;
  private emailService: EmailService;
  private inventoryManager: InventoryManager;

  constructor() {
    this.paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
    this.emailService = new EmailService();
    this.inventoryManager = new InventoryManager();
  }

  placeOrder(productId: string, quantity: number, amount: number): void {
    this.paymentProcessor.processPayment(amount);

    this.inventoryManager.updateInventory(productId, quantity);

    const orderId = this.generateOrderId();
    this.emailService.sendConfirmationEmail(orderId);

    console.log('Order placed successfully!');
  }

  private generateOrderId(): string {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substring(7); // Generate a simple order ID
  }
}
```

Each class now has **one specific responsibility**, making the system easier to maintain and allowing changes to one area (e.g., payment processing) without affecting others (like email sending or inventory management). This separation also makes the code more testable and flexible, as each part can evolve independently.

# OCP - Open/Closed Principle

Now, you understand what SRP is and how to apply it. But let’s suppose you need to add a new feature to your system. What do you do? Do you go into the existing code and start modifying it? What if this modification breaks something that was already working? This is where the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** comes into play.

The OCP states that software should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that whenever you need to add new functionality, you should be able to do so without modifying the existing code—that is, without touching what’s already working. Instead, you should extend the behavior of the system through inheritance, interface implementation, or composition, while preserving the already tested and working code.

Let’s make this clearer with an example. Imagine you have a system that calculates discounts, such as a fixed discount and a percentage discount. If tomorrow the sales team wants to add a new type of discount, like a loyalty discount, you should not modify the existing classes to include this new logic. Instead, you would create a new class that implements the loyalty discount logic, extending the system without changing the previous code.

Here are two examples in TypeScript, one following the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** correctly and one violating it.

### **Example Violating OCP (Wrong Way)**

In this example, we violate OCP by directly modifying the existing `DiscountCalculator` class every time we add a new discount type.

```typescript
// Violating OCP: Modifying existing code to add new discount logic
class DiscountCalculator {
  calculateDiscount(type: string, amount: number): number {
    if (type === 'fixed') {
      return amount - 10; // Fixed discount
    } else if (type === 'percentage') {
      return amount * 0.9; // 10% discount
    } else if (type === 'loyalty') {
      return amount * 0.85; // 15% loyalty discount
    }
    return amount; // No discount
  }
}

// Example usage
const discountCalculator = new DiscountCalculator();
console.log(discountCalculator.calculateDiscount('fixed', 100));       // 90
console.log(discountCalculator.calculateDiscount('percentage', 100));  // 90
console.log(discountCalculator.calculateDiscount('loyalty', 100));     // 85
```

### **Why This Violates OCP:**
- Every time a new discount type is added, you must modify the `DiscountCalculator` class.
- This makes the code less maintainable, as every change increases the risk of introducing bugs.
- It’s harder to extend the functionality without modifying existing code.

### **Example Following OCP (Correct Way)**

In this example, we follow OCP by creating a base `DiscountStrategy` class and allowing new discount types to be added through extension without modifying the existing `DiscountCalculator` class.

```typescript
// Following OCP: Extending functionality by adding new classes
interface DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number;
}

// Fixed Discount Strategy
class FixedDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount - 10; // Fixed discount
  }
}

// Percentage Discount Strategy
class PercentageDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.9; // 10% discount
  }
}

// Loyalty Discount Strategy (New discount type added without modifying existing code)
class LoyaltyDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.85; // 15% loyalty discount
  }
}

// DiscountCalculator that uses any DiscountStrategy
class DiscountCalculator {
  private discountStrategy: DiscountStrategy;

  constructor(discountStrategy: DiscountStrategy) {
    this.discountStrategy = discountStrategy;
  }

  calculateDiscount(amount: number): number {
    return this.discountStrategy.calculate(amount);
  }
}

// Example usage
const fixedDiscount = new DiscountCalculator(new FixedDiscount());
console.log(fixedDiscount.calculateDiscount(100)); // 90

const percentageDiscount = new DiscountCalculator(new PercentageDiscount());
console.log(percentageDiscount.calculateDiscount(100)); // 90

const loyaltyDiscount = new DiscountCalculator(new LoyaltyDiscount());
console.log(loyaltyDiscount.calculateDiscount(100)); // 85
```

### **Why This Follows OCP:**
- The `DiscountCalculator` class is **closed for modification** but **open for extension**.
- You can add new discount types (like `LoyaltyDiscount`) by creating new classes without changing the existing logic in `DiscountCalculator`.
- The system becomes more flexible, allowing for easy extension as new requirements arise.

This structure makes the code easier to maintain and extend while minimizing the risk of breaking existing functionality.
