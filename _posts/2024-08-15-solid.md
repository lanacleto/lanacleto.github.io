Your'e walking at the street, look around and then just realize you still don't know SOLID, that's why I'm here.

# What in a hell is S.O.L.I.D.?

The year is 2000, the renowned developer Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob," was facing a common challenge in the world of software development: the difficulty of maintaining and evolving complex systems. As the complexity of software projects grew, many developers struggled to create systems that were easy to understand, modify, and expand.

In response to this scenario, Uncle Bob began working on a set of principles that could help developers address these issues. He introduced the concept of SOLID, an acronym for five fundamental principles designed to improve code structure and flexibility. These principles were intended to solve problems such as high coupling between components, difficulty in adding new features, and the complexity of legacy code.

In this article we gonna go through the following principles:

- **S - Single Responsibility Principle**
- **O - Open/Closed Principle**
- **L - Liskov Substitution Principle**
- **I - Interface Segregation Principle**
- **D - Dependency Inversion Principle**

# SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle states that we, as developers, should always strive to assign only **ONE responsibility** to each class individually. In other words, no class should take on multiple, unrelated duties. By adhering to this principle, we can ensure that our classes are easier to maintain, understand, and modify, as each class will have a clear, well-defined purpose.

For instance, imagine youâ€™re building a simple online store. You might be tempted to create a class called `OrderManager` that handles everything related to an order: processing payments, sending confirmation emails, updating inventory, and more, as following example:

```typescript
class OrderManager {
  // Process payment, update inventory, and send email all in one class
  placeOrder(productId: string, quantity: number, amount: number): void {
    this.processPayment(amount);
    this.updateInventory(productId, quantity);

    const orderId = this.generateOrderId();
    this.sendConfirmationEmail(orderId);

    console.log('Order placed successfully!');
  }

  private processPayment(amount: number): void {
    console.log(`Processing payment of $${amount}`);
  }

  private updateInventory(productId: string, quantity: number): void {
    console.log(`Updating inventory for product ${productId}, reducing by ${quantity}`);
  }

  private sendConfirmationEmail(orderId: string): void {
    console.log(`Sending confirmation email for order ${orderId}`);
  }

  private generateOrderId(): string {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substring(7); // Generate a simple order ID
  }
}
```

However, this violates SRP, as this class has multiple responsibilities. Instead, you could break it down into:

- A `PaymentProcessor` class responsible solely for handling payments.
- An `EmailService` class dedicated to sending confirmation emails.
- An `InventoryManager` class that manages the stock.

```typescript
// Class responsible for processing payments
class PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount: number): void {
    console.log(`Processing payment of $${amount}`);
  }
}

// Class responsible for sending emails
class EmailService {
  sendConfirmationEmail(orderId: string): void {
    console.log(`Sending confirmation email for order ${orderId}`);
  }
}

// Class responsible for managing inventory
class InventoryManager {
  updateInventory(productId: string, quantity: number): void {
    console.log(`Updating inventory for product ${productId}, reducing by ${quantity}`);
  }
}

// High-level OrderManager class that coordinates actions but does not perform them
class OrderManager {
  private paymentProcessor: PaymentProcessor;
  private emailService: EmailService;
  private inventoryManager: InventoryManager;

  constructor() {
    this.paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
    this.emailService = new EmailService();
    this.inventoryManager = new InventoryManager();
  }

  placeOrder(productId: string, quantity: number, amount: number): void {
    this.paymentProcessor.processPayment(amount);

    this.inventoryManager.updateInventory(productId, quantity);

    const orderId = this.generateOrderId();
    this.emailService.sendConfirmationEmail(orderId);

    console.log('Order placed successfully!');
  }

  private generateOrderId(): string {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substring(7); // Generate a simple order ID
  }
}
```

Each class now has **one specific responsibility**, making the system easier to maintain and allowing changes to one area (e.g., payment processing) without affecting others (like email sending or inventory management). This separation also makes the code more testable and flexible, as each part can evolve independently.
