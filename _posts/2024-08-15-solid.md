Your'e walking at the street, look around and then just realize you still don't know SOLID, that's why I'm here.

# What in a hell is S.O.L.I.D.?

The year is 2000, the renowned developer Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob," was facing a common challenge in the world of software development: the difficulty of maintaining and evolving complex systems. As the complexity of software projects grew, many developers struggled to create systems that were easy to understand, modify, and expand.

In response to this scenario, Uncle Bob began working on a set of principles that could help developers address these issues. He introduced the concept of SOLID, an acronym for five fundamental principles designed to improve code structure and flexibility. These principles were intended to solve problems such as high coupling between components, difficulty in adding new features, and the complexity of legacy code.

In this article we gonna go through the following principles:

- **S - Single Responsibility Principle**
- **O - Open/Closed Principle**
- **L - Liskov Substitution Principle**
- **I - Interface Segregation Principle**
- **D - Dependency Inversion Principle**

# SRP - Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle states that we, as developers, should always strive to assign only **ONE responsibility** to each class individually. In other words, no class should take on multiple, unrelated duties. By adhering to this principle, we can ensure that our classes are easier to maintain, understand, and modify, as each class will have a clear, well-defined purpose.

For instance, imagine you’re building a simple online store. You might be tempted to create a class called `OrderManager` that handles everything related to an order: processing payments, sending confirmation emails, updating inventory, and more, as following example:

```typescript
class OrderManager {
  // Process payment, update inventory, and send email all in one class
  placeOrder(productId: string, quantity: number, amount: number): void {
    this.processPayment(amount);
    this.updateInventory(productId, quantity);

    const orderId = this.generateOrderId();
    this.sendConfirmationEmail(orderId);

    console.log('Order placed successfully!');
  }

  private processPayment(amount: number): void {
    console.log(`Processing payment of $${amount}`);
  }

  private updateInventory(productId: string, quantity: number): void {
    console.log(`Updating inventory for product ${productId}, reducing by ${quantity}`);
  }

  private sendConfirmationEmail(orderId: string): void {
    console.log(`Sending confirmation email for order ${orderId}`);
  }

  private generateOrderId(): string {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substring(7); // Generate a simple order ID
  }
}
```

However, this violates SRP, as this class has multiple responsibilities. Instead, you could break it down into:

- A `PaymentProcessor` class responsible solely for handling payments.
- An `EmailService` class dedicated to sending confirmation emails.
- An `InventoryManager` class that manages the stock.

```typescript
// Class responsible for processing payments
class PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount: number): void {
    console.log(`Processing payment of $${amount}`);
  }
}

// Class responsible for sending emails
class EmailService {
  sendConfirmationEmail(orderId: string): void {
    console.log(`Sending confirmation email for order ${orderId}`);
  }
}

// Class responsible for managing inventory
class InventoryManager {
  updateInventory(productId: string, quantity: number): void {
    console.log(`Updating inventory for product ${productId}, reducing by ${quantity}`);
  }
}

// High-level OrderManager class that coordinates actions but does not perform them
class OrderManager {
  private paymentProcessor: PaymentProcessor;
  private emailService: EmailService;
  private inventoryManager: InventoryManager;

  constructor() {
    this.paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor();
    this.emailService = new EmailService();
    this.inventoryManager = new InventoryManager();
  }

  placeOrder(productId: string, quantity: number, amount: number): void {
    this.paymentProcessor.processPayment(amount);

    this.inventoryManager.updateInventory(productId, quantity);

    const orderId = this.generateOrderId();
    this.emailService.sendConfirmationEmail(orderId);

    console.log('Order placed successfully!');
  }

  private generateOrderId(): string {
    return Math.random().toString(36).substring(7); // Generate a simple order ID
  }
}
```

Each class now has **one specific responsibility**, making the system easier to maintain and allowing changes to one area (e.g., payment processing) without affecting others (like email sending or inventory management). This separation also makes the code more testable and flexible, as each part can evolve independently.

# OCP - Open/Closed Principle

Now, you understand what SRP is and how to apply it. But let’s suppose you need to add a new feature to your system. What do you do? Do you go into the existing code and start modifying it? What if this modification breaks something that was already working? This is where the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** comes into play.

The OCP states that software should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that whenever you need to add new functionality, you should be able to do so without modifying the existing code—that is, without touching what’s already working. Instead, you should extend the behavior of the system through inheritance, interface implementation, or composition, while preserving the already tested and working code.

Let’s make this clearer with an example. Imagine you have a system that calculates discounts, such as a fixed discount and a percentage discount. If tomorrow the sales team wants to add a new type of discount, like a loyalty discount, you should not modify the existing classes to include this new logic. Instead, you would create a new class that implements the loyalty discount logic, extending the system without changing the previous code.

Here are two examples in TypeScript, one following the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** correctly and one violating it.

### **Example Violating OCP (Wrong Way)**

In this example, we violate OCP by directly modifying the existing `DiscountCalculator` class every time we add a new discount type.

```typescript
// Violating OCP: Modifying existing code to add new discount logic
class DiscountCalculator {
  calculateDiscount(type: string, amount: number): number {
    if (type === 'fixed') {
      return amount - 10; // Fixed discount
    } else if (type === 'percentage') {
      return amount * 0.9; // 10% discount
    } else if (type === 'loyalty') {
      return amount * 0.85; // 15% loyalty discount
    }
    return amount; // No discount
  }
}

// Example usage
const discountCalculator = new DiscountCalculator();
console.log(discountCalculator.calculateDiscount('fixed', 100));       // 90
console.log(discountCalculator.calculateDiscount('percentage', 100));  // 90
console.log(discountCalculator.calculateDiscount('loyalty', 100));     // 85
```

### **Why This Violates OCP:**
- Every time a new discount type is added, you must modify the `DiscountCalculator` class.
- This makes the code less maintainable, as every change increases the risk of introducing bugs.
- It’s harder to extend the functionality without modifying existing code.

### **Example Following OCP (Correct Way)**

In this example, we follow OCP by creating a base `DiscountStrategy` class and allowing new discount types to be added through extension without modifying the existing `DiscountCalculator` class.

```typescript
// Following OCP: Extending functionality by adding new classes
interface DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number;
}

// Fixed Discount Strategy
class FixedDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount - 10; // Fixed discount
  }
}

// Percentage Discount Strategy
class PercentageDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.9; // 10% discount
  }
}

// Loyalty Discount Strategy (New discount type added without modifying existing code)
class LoyaltyDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
  calculate(amount: number): number {
    return amount * 0.85; // 15% loyalty discount
  }
}

// DiscountCalculator that uses any DiscountStrategy
class DiscountCalculator {
  private discountStrategy: DiscountStrategy;

  constructor(discountStrategy: DiscountStrategy) {
    this.discountStrategy = discountStrategy;
  }

  calculateDiscount(amount: number): number {
    return this.discountStrategy.calculate(amount);
  }
}

// Example usage
const fixedDiscount = new DiscountCalculator(new FixedDiscount());
console.log(fixedDiscount.calculateDiscount(100)); // 90

const percentageDiscount = new DiscountCalculator(new PercentageDiscount());
console.log(percentageDiscount.calculateDiscount(100)); // 90

const loyaltyDiscount = new DiscountCalculator(new LoyaltyDiscount());
console.log(loyaltyDiscount.calculateDiscount(100)); // 85
```

### **Why This Follows OCP:**
- The `DiscountCalculator` class is **closed for modification** but **open for extension**.
- You can add new discount types (like `LoyaltyDiscount`) by creating new classes without changing the existing logic in `DiscountCalculator`.
- The system becomes more flexible, allowing for easy extension as new requirements arise.

This structure makes the code easier to maintain and extend while minimizing the risk of breaking existing functionality.

# LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the most important principles within SOLID, formulated by Barbara Liskov in 1987. In simple terms, LSP ensures that subclasses should be able to replace their parent class without affecting the correctness of the program. This means that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced by objects of its subclass without altering the intended behavior of the system.

To put it in another way: "If class B is a subclass of class A, then you should be able to replace instances of A with instances of B without disrupting the functionality of your program."

**Key Concept:**
LSP ensures that subclasses behave in a way that is consistent with what clients (code that uses the class) expect from the superclass. If a subclass changes behavior in a way that violates this expectation, it breaks LSP. 

**Why is LSP important?**
Imagine you’re working with a framework where you want to allow extensions (e.g., inheriting classes). If those extensions break the original functionality, then the codebase becomes hard to maintain and reason about. By adhering to LSP, your system remains modular and easily extendable.

**LSP in Practice:**
Let’s take a classic example involving a Rectangle and a Square. In this case, you might think a Square is a type of Rectangle since it shares some properties (e.g., has width and height). However, as we will see, a Square cannot substitute a Rectangle without violating LSP.

**Violation of LSP:**

```typescript
// Base class Rectangle
class Rectangle {
  private width: number;
  private height: number;

  setWidth(width: number) {
    this.width = width;
  }

  setHeight(height: number) {
    this.height = height;
  }

  getArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

// Subclass Square
class Square extends Rectangle {
  setWidth(width: number) {
    // Override to ensure width and height remain equal
    super.setWidth(width);
    super.setHeight(width);
  }

  setHeight(height: number) {
    // Override to ensure width and height remain equal
    super.setWidth(height);
    super.setHeight(height);
  }
}

// Client code
const rectangle: Rectangle = new Square();
rectangle.setWidth(5);
rectangle.setHeight(10);

// The client expects the area to be 50 (5*10), but it is 100, which violates the expectation
console.log(rectangle.getArea()); // Output: 100
```

**Why This Violates LSP:**
- The `Square` class changes the expected behavior of the `Rectangle` class by overriding the `setWidth` and `setHeight` methods.
- The client code is now broken because it expects to set the width and height independently (which is possible with a regular rectangle), but the `Square` enforces both dimensions to be the same.

**Correct Way to Adhere to LSP:**
Instead of forcing inheritance where it doesn’t make sense, consider separating the logic and avoiding subclassing in cases where behaviors differ significantly.

```typescript
// Separate Rectangle and Square into their own independent classes

class Rectangle {
  constructor(private width: number, private height: number) {}

  getArea(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

class Square {
  constructor(private side: number) {}

  getArea(): number {
    return this.side * this.side;
  }
}

// Now both classes have their own responsibilities and follow LSP
const rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 10);
console.log(rectangle.getArea()); // Output: 50

const square = new Square(5);
console.log(square.getArea()); // Output: 25
```

By separating these two classes, you respect LSP, keeping the logic predictable and easy to understand. Each class now has a single, well-defined purpose that does not interfere with the expectations set by other parts of the code.

**Takeaway:**
LSP is crucial for maintaining flexibility and stability in your system. It ensures that extending your code with subclasses will not lead to unexpected issues. By following this principle, your system will remain robust, allowing you to extend functionality without breaking existing behaviors.

# ISP - Interface Segregation Principle

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is the fourth principle in the SOLID acronym, and it emphasizes the importance of keeping interfaces small and specific to the clients that need them. ISP states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. In other words, large, monolithic interfaces should be broken down into smaller, more focused ones to prevent implementing classes from being burdened with unused methods.

This principle is all about **avoiding "fat" interfaces** and ensuring that classes implement only what they actually need. When a class is forced to implement unnecessary methods, it leads to a bloated design that is harder to maintain, test, and extend.

### Key Concept:
- **Fat Interfaces**: Interfaces that declare more methods than any single implementing class needs, making those classes unnecessarily dependent on methods they don’t use.
- **Specific Interfaces**: Smaller, more precise interfaces tailored to the specific needs of their clients.

### Why is ISP important?
When you violate ISP, classes that implement large interfaces end up with methods that are irrelevant to their purpose. This not only clutters your code but also increases the likelihood of errors, making maintenance more difficult over time. Following ISP ensures that classes remain cohesive and modular, each focusing on its actual responsibilities.

### Example of ISP Violation:

Let’s imagine we are working with a system that manages different types of workers in a company: part-time employees, full-time employees, and contractors. We create an interface called `Worker` that has methods for all kinds of workers:

```typescript
// Violating ISP with a "fat" interface
interface Worker {
  work(): void;
  attendMeeting(): void;
  getSalary(): number;
  getBenefits(): string[]; // Only full-time workers get benefits
}

class FullTimeEmployee implements Worker {
  work(): void {
    console.log("Working full-time");
  }

  attendMeeting(): void {
    console.log("Attending meeting");
  }

  getSalary(): number {
    return 5000;
  }

  getBenefits(): string[] {
    return ['Health Insurance', 'Retirement Plan'];
  }
}

class Contractor implements Worker {
  work(): void {
    console.log("Working as a contractor");
  }

  attendMeeting(): void {
    console.log("Attending meeting");
  }

  getSalary(): number {
    return 3000;
  }

  // Contractor has no benefits but is forced to implement the method
  getBenefits(): string[] {
    return []; // Unused method for contractors
  }
}
```

**Why This Violates ISP:**
- The `Contractor` class is forced to implement the `getBenefits` method even though contractors don’t receive any benefits.
- This leads to unnecessary code that doesn’t make sense in the context of a contractor. Over time, this can make the system harder to maintain as more workers are added, each requiring different methods from the `Worker` interface.

### Correct Implementation Following ISP:

To follow the Interface Segregation Principle, we can break down the large `Worker` interface into smaller, more specific ones. Each worker type will implement only the interfaces it truly needs:

```typescript
// Breaking down the large Worker interface into smaller ones

interface Workable {
  work(): void;
}

interface MeetingParticipant {
  attendMeeting(): void;
}

interface Salaried {
  getSalary(): number;
}

interface BenefitReceiver {
  getBenefits(): string[];
}

// Now, each class implements only what it needs

class FullTimeEmployee implements Workable, MeetingParticipant, Salaried, BenefitReceiver {
  work(): void {
    console.log("Working full-time");
  }

  attendMeeting(): void {
    console.log("Attending meeting");
  }

  getSalary(): number {
    return 5000;
  }

  getBenefits(): string[] {
    return ['Health Insurance', 'Retirement Plan'];
  }
}

class Contractor implements Workable, MeetingParticipant, Salaried {
  work(): void {
    console.log("Working as a contractor");
  }

  attendMeeting(): void {
    console.log("Attending meeting");
  }

  getSalary(): number {
    return 3000;
  }

  // Contractor no longer needs to implement getBenefits
}
```

**Why This Follows ISP:**
- Each class implements only the interfaces that are relevant to it. For example, the `Contractor` class no longer implements `BenefitReceiver` because contractors don’t receive benefits.
- The system becomes more modular and easier to maintain since classes don’t need to handle unnecessary functionality.
- It also makes future extensions easier, as new worker types can implement only the interfaces they require.

### Benefits of Following ISP:
- **Cohesion**: Classes focus only on what they need to do, leading to better cohesion and clarity.
- **Maintenance**: Smaller, more focused interfaces make the code easier to understand and modify. Changes to one part of the system don’t force changes in unrelated parts.
- **Flexibility**: It’s easier to extend the system with new functionality without affecting existing code, leading to a more adaptable system.

### Takeaway:
The Interface Segregation Principle encourages designing small, focused interfaces that provide only the methods that are necessary for the specific functionality of a class. By doing so, we avoid the pitfalls of bloated interfaces and ensure that our code is more maintainable, flexible, and easier to understand in the long term.

# DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is the fifth and final principle of SOLID. It focuses on the way dependencies between high-level and low-level modules should be structured. DIP states that high-level modules, which contain complex logic and business rules, should not depend on low-level modules that perform detailed operations. Instead, both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes). Furthermore, abstractions should not depend on details, but rather, details should depend on abstractions.

This principle "inverts" the traditional idea that higher-level components should rely on lower-level ones. Instead, both layers should depend on abstractions, making the system more flexible and reducing tight coupling.

### Key Concepts:
- **High-Level Modules**: These are classes or components that handle the core business logic and significant decisions within an application.
- **Low-Level Modules**: These are classes or components that handle the detailed operations like accessing databases, performing input/output (I/O), etc.
- **Abstraction**: Interfaces or abstract classes that define a contract for what behavior is needed, without specifying how it should be implemented.

### Why is DIP important?

DIP reduces the tight coupling between classes and allows the higher-level policies to remain independent of the details. When high-level modules depend directly on low-level ones, any change in the low-level component forces changes in the high-level one, which makes the system rigid and hard to maintain. By introducing abstractions (e.g., interfaces) between them, we achieve **loose coupling** and greater flexibility for changes.

### Example of DIP Violation:

Let’s imagine we are building an application that sends notifications through email. If we violate the DIP, our high-level module would depend directly on the low-level email service class. Here’s an example of a violation:

```typescript
class EmailService {
  sendEmail(to: string, body: string): void {
    console.log(`Sending email to ${to}: ${body}`);
  }
}

class Notification {
  private emailService: EmailService;

  constructor() {
    this.emailService = new EmailService();
  }

  send(to: string, message: string): void {
    this.emailService.sendEmail(to, message);
  }
}
```

**Why This Violates DIP:**
- The `Notification` class, which is a high-level module, is tightly coupled to the `EmailService`, a low-level module. If we ever wanted to send notifications through a different service (e.g., SMS or push notifications), we would have to modify the `Notification` class, breaking the open/closed principle as well.

### Correct Implementation Following DIP:

To follow the Dependency Inversion Principle, we need to create an abstraction (e.g., `INotificationService` interface) that both the high-level `Notification` class and low-level implementations (like `EmailService`, `SMSService`) will depend on. This way, the `Notification` class doesn’t depend directly on any specific low-level service, but on an abstraction that can be implemented in different ways.

```typescript
// Define an abstraction that both high and low-level modules will depend on
interface INotificationService {
  send(to: string, message: string): void;
}

// Low-level implementation: Email service
class EmailService implements INotificationService {
  send(to: string, message: string): void {
    console.log(`Sending email to ${to}: ${message}`);
  }
}

// Low-level implementation: SMS service
class SMSService implements INotificationService {
  send(to: string, message: string): void {
    console.log(`Sending SMS to ${to}: ${message}`);
  }
}

// High-level module now depends on the abstraction (INotificationService)
class Notification {
  private notificationService: INotificationService;

  // Dependency Injection via constructor
  constructor(service: INotificationService) {
    this.notificationService = service;
  }

  send(to: string, message: string): void {
    this.notificationService.send(to, message);
  }
}

// Usage examples:

const emailService = new EmailService();
const notification = new Notification(emailService); // Inject the email service
notification.send("user@example.com", "Hello via Email!");

const smsService = new SMSService();
const notification2 = new Notification(smsService); // Inject the SMS service
notification2.send("1234567890", "Hello via SMS!");
```

**Why This Follows DIP:**
- The `Notification` class now depends on the `INotificationService` abstraction rather than any concrete implementation. It doesn't care whether the notification is sent via email, SMS, or any other method. This makes the system **loosely coupled**.
- The high-level `Notification` class remains unchanged if we want to add new notification methods (like push notifications). We can simply create a new class that implements the `INotificationService` interface.

### Benefits of Following DIP:

1. **Loosely Coupled Code**: High-level modules are not tightly coupled to low-level implementations, leading to flexible and adaptable code.
2. **Easier to Extend**: You can introduce new low-level modules (e.g., new services) without modifying the high-level ones.
3. **Improved Testability**: With abstractions, it becomes easier to substitute real implementations with mock objects for testing purposes.
4. **Maintainability**: The high-level policy or business rules are isolated from implementation details, making the system easier to maintain and evolve.

### Takeaway:
The Dependency Inversion Principle encourages a design where high-level modules depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations. By introducing abstractions and using techniques like dependency injection, we can achieve loose coupling, making our code more flexible, maintainable, and easier to extend.

And that’s it! By following the SOLID principles—SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP—you can create cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code. These principles help you build flexible systems that are easier to evolve and less prone to breaking when new features are added. Apply them, and watch your codebase transform!
