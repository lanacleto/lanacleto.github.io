I am Luiz Anacleto, a front-end developer with a passion for creating exceptional web experiences. 

From an early age, I have been honing my skills and, in recent years, have specialized in Angular,
performance, and accessibility. I take pride in having completed projects that received praise from clients and endusers. Additionally, I have experience with React, having used this technology in a previous role and currently
studying to stay updated with industry trends. I am always on the lookout for new technologies and trends to
continue evolving and making significant contributions.
